# Simple Bot to notify about INIS appontments that becomes available
"""
This Bot uses the Updater class to handle the bot.
First, a few handler functions are defined. Then, those functions are passed to
the Dispatcher and registered at their respective places.
Then, the bot is started and runs until we press Ctrl-C on the command line.
Usage:
Basic notification Bot, it looks for available appointments to GNIB office and posts updates into specific channel.
Press Ctrl-C on the command line or send a signal to the process to stop the
bot.

TODO:

- add check whether or not http request was successful
